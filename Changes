      - The type of the Time::NVtime pointer is NV ()() not double ()(), as can be seen from looking at the Time::HiRes source.
        On Linux x86_64 on a uselongdouble build when you replace the Time::NVtime entry with a
        double (*)() pointer calls to that function end up leaving an entry on the FPU stack,
        eventually causing the failure seen at https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123879
        This minimal commit fixes that issue and allows DBIX::Class::TimeStamp to pass its tests.
